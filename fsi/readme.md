# Financial Services Industry (FSI) Landing Zones on Microsoft Azure

The FSI Landing Zones on Microsoft Azure is an architecture and design methdology, with a proven reference implementation that is developed after years of learnings and experience, working closely with our most complex and sophisticated customers in the financial services industry.

Due to being in a highly regulated industry, where strict and non-negotionable compliance requirements must be met and is the nature of the FSI business, organizations in the FSI industry have unique requirements compared to other organizations of similar scale. Such requirements include.

* Delivery of a secure-by-default infrastructure that meets the regulatory compliance requirements, every hour, every day, and every year.
* Highly-resillient foundation to ensure mission-critical applications - such as payment gateways are meeting the required service level agreement(s) (SLA).
* Foundation that caters for generic - and industry specific workloads and scenarios, with balancing various degree of security and compliance requirements. 

This article provides a reference architecture with prescriptive guidance and recommendations for the FSI industry on Microsoft Azure.
